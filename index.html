	<h2>My passion for chess<h2>
	<p> I realy like chess, as it's a simple game, with a lot of complication and strategy. it's also a competitve game, with two players who confront themself. it's also a friendly game, to enjoy.</p>

	<h3>Monkeys</h3>
	<p> I also like monkeys, as they are funny and very smart animals, with some human comportement. To illustrate they use tool, and have a huge social system, with different status and code</p>
